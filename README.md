# My dashboard is to provide a preliminary analysis of the Real Estate Market in Toronto.
# The first tab provides a overall picture of the market based on the most current census. The second tab shows how the average value of a house in toronto has significantly increased over the 5 year periods. The comparison with the Shelter Costs show in each 5 year period the percentage change in the average house value, shelter costs for owning and renting. The neighborhood analsyis provides an indepth view of the average house values in each neighborhood over the 5 year periods. I find this tab the most useful to see the changes in the market. The most expensive neighborhood tab shows how the most premium neighborhoods in the city have changed based on the house values.
